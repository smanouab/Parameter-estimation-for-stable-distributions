# Estimation-for-stable-distributions
W consider parameter estimation for stable distributions and their mixture. We propose firstly an estimation method based on the characteristic function by the use of a Gaussian kernel estimator of the density distribution. The choice of the optimal bandwidth parameter was done using a plug-in method. We highlight another estimation procedure for the maximum likelihood framework based on the false-position algorithm to find a numerical root of the log-likelihood through the score functions. In the case of a mixture stable distributions, the EM algorithm and the Bayesian estimation method were modified in order to propose an efficient tool for parameter estimation.  A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our methods which are then applied to real data.
