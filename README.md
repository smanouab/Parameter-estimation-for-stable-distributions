# Parameter-estimation-for-stable-distributions
We consider parameter estimation for stable distributions and their mixture. We propose firstly an estimation method based on the characteristic function by the use of a Gaussian kernel estimator of the density distribution. The choice of the optimal bandwidth parameter was done using a plug-in method. We highlight another estimation procedure for the maximum likelihood framework based on the False-position algorithm to find a numerical root of the log-likelihood through the score functions. In the case of a mixture stable distributions, the EM algorithm and the Bayesian estimation method were adapted in order to propose an efficient tool for parameter estimation.
