# Python package for Parameter-estimation-for-stable-distributions
We consider parameter estimation for stable distributions and their mixture. We  Provides various functions for parameter estimation of one-dimensional stable distributions and their mixtures. It implements a diverse set of estimation methods, including quantile-based approaches, regression methods based on the empirical characteristic function (empirical, kernel, and recursive), and maximum likelihood estimation. For mixture models, it provides stochastic expectation–maximization (SEM) algorithms and Bayesian estimation methods using sampling and importance sampling to overcome the long burn-in period of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategies. The package also includes tools and statistical tests for analyzing whether a dataset follows a stable distribution. 

Some of the implemented methods are described in Hajjaji, O., Manou-Abi, S. M., and Slaoui, Y. (2024). Parameter estimation for stable distributions and their mixture. Journal of Applied Statistics <doi:10.1080/02664763.2024.2434627>.
